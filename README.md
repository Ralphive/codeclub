# codeclub
Welcome to our Code Club UK. Our weekly meeting where we learn basic concepts of programming and computer science.

The projects we are going to create use a programming language called [Python](https://python.org). This is used for real projects in industry, so itâ€™s a useful language to learn. 

We are going to use [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to create our programs. It allows you to save all of your code, but to do so, you need an account (it's free). Just ask for an adult to create an account for you.


## Projects:

### Week 1 - About me 
* Login to your account on [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) or [start a blank code here](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)
* [Follow the steps of the project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/about-me/3)
