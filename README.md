# codeclub
Welcome to our Code Club UK. Our weekly meeting where we learn basic concepts of programming and computer science.

The projects we are going to create use a programming language called [Python](https://python.org). This is used for real projects in industry, so itâ€™s a useful language to learn. 

We are going to use [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to create our programs. It allows you to save all of your code, but to do so, you need an account (it's free). Just ask for an adult to create an account for you.


## Projects:
### For Every week
* [start a blank code here](http://jumpto.cc/python-new) or Login to your account on [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) or 


### Week 1 - About me 
In this project you will learn how to write a Python program telling people all about you.
* [Follow the project's steps](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/about-me/3)
* [Presentation](Week1/Week1.pptx)


### Week 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors
In this project you will make a Rock, Paper, Scissors game and play against the computer.

Rules: You and the computer both choose rock, paper or scissors. 

The winner is decided by these rules:

Rock blunts scissors, Paper covers rock, Scissors cut paper

* [Follow the project's steps](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors/2)
* [Presentation](Week2/Week2.pptx)
* [Finished Exerciese](Week2/rock-paper-scissors-finished.py)

### Week 3 - Turtle Race
This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. If you have a group of people to play the game, each person pick a turtle and the one that gets the furthest is the winner.

Rules: You and the computer both choose rock, paper or scissors. 

The winner is decided by these rules:

Rock blunts scissors, Paper covers rock, Scissors cut paper

* [Follow the project's steps](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race/3)

### Week 4 - Loops Concepts
No Challenge this week. We are going to focus on Loops fundamental.
